## Introduction

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is the standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It enables users to store, retrieve, update, and delete data in a structured format. SQL became an ANSI standard in 1986 and an ISO standard in 1987.

:::note
**Key Features of SQL:**

- **Data Querying:** Retrieve data from tables using commands like `SELECT`.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Add, update, or delete records using `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Define database structures using `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`.
- **DCL (Data Control Language):** Control access and permissions with `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Manage transactions with `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`.

Let‚Äôs talk about the history of data storage:

Data storage began with physical files and shelves. Later, companies started using tools like Excel and Access. However, these tools have limitations when handling large data volumes.

To overcome these challenges, companies developed database management systems (DBMS) such as SQL databases (like PostgreSQL and MySQL).

> There are two main types of databases:
> 
> - **SQL/Relational databases** (supports Online Transaction Processing [OLTP] and Online Analytical Processing [OLAP]).
> - **NoSQL databases** (key-value, graph, document)‚Äîoften used for semi-structured or unstructured datasets. NoSQL databases provide more flexibility than relational databases because they don‚Äôt require fixed schemas.

> **Schema:** A schema is a named collection of tables and can also include views, indexes, datatypes, operators, and functions.

| 17    | Window Functions (`RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`) | Performs calculations across sets of rows related to the current row.   |

#### Structure and Content

In SQL, the *structure* refers to how data is organized in tables; the *content* refers to the actual data stored within those tables.

| **Category**  | **Alias** | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Tuple         | Row       | Record          |
| Attribute     | Column    | Field           |
:::

**Example: The following SQL code creates a table named `Students`.**

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Basic SQL">
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE Students (
ID INT,
Name VARCHAR(50),
Age INT
);

-- Insert a record (recommended: specify column names)
INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name, Age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 22);

-- Query the table
SELECT * FROM Students;

-- Update a record
UPDATE Students SET Age = 23 WHERE ID = 1;

-- Delete a record
DELETE FROM Students WHERE ID = 1;

text
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Output">
-- After creating the table and inserting a record:
ID Name Age
1 Alice 22

-- After updating the record:
ID Name Age
1 Alice 23

-- After deleting the record:
(No rows returned)

text
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="DDL">
-- CREATE TABLE statement to create a new table with columns and data types
CREATE TABLE customers (
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(50),
email VARCHAR(50)
);

-- ALTER TABLE statement to add a new column to an existing table
ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);

-- DROP TABLE statement to remove a table from the database
DROP TABLE customers;

text
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="DML">
-- INSERT statement to add new data to a table
INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@email.com');

-- UPDATE statement to modify existing data in a table
UPDATE customers SET email = 'new@email.com' WHERE name = 'John Doe';

-- DELETE statement to remove data from a table
DELETE FROM customers WHERE name = 'John Doe';

text
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="DCL">
-- CREATE USER and GRANT statements (syntax may vary by DBMS)
CREATE USER 'new_user' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON customers TO new_user;

text
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TCL">
-- BEGIN TRANSACTION statement to start a new transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- COMMIT statement to save changes made during a transaction
COMMIT;

-- ROLLBACK statement to undo changes made during a transaction
ROLLBACK;

text
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Advantages: Platform Independence ‚Äî Yes and No

The core SQL language (based on ANSI/ISO standards) is platform independent, meaning the basic syntax and concepts‚Äîsuch as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`‚Äîare the same across different database systems.

However, most Database Management Systems (DBMS)‚Äîlike MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite‚Äîextend SQL differently:

- Use different data types (e.g., `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`)
- Offer custom functions and features
- Handle stored procedures, triggers, and syntax differently
- Provide varied tools and optimization strategies

As a result, SQL code written for one system might not work exactly the same on another without some adjustments.

# üóÉÔ∏è Why Learn SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing and querying relational databases‚Äîthe most common method businesses use to store data. Whether it's **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQL Server**, or **SQLite**‚Äîall use SQL!

Data engineering involves collecting, transforming, and storing data so it is accessible for analysis. SQL is a crucial tool in this process because it allows you to:

1. **Retrieve data:** Query the database for specific information based on criteria.
2. **Manipulate data:** Add, delete, or update data to keep it accurate and up to date.
3. **Manage data:** Create tables, define relationships, and set up permissions to keep data organized and secure.
