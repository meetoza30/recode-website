# ðŸ“— Ordering Data

Welcome to the **Selecting Data** module! This foundational learning path is designed to help you master the basics of querying data, particularly focusing on how to retrieve specific information from databases effectively.

### ðŸ“˜ Creating SQL Table

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to interpret and use rows in a database table. Tables are essential to storing structured data, and each **row** in a table represents a unique **item or record**.
> Each row of a table represents a new item.

> Each column of a table represents a specific attribute of the data, such as `id`, `name`, or `username`. 
> These columns define the **type of information** stored for each item in the table.


For example, consider a table named `Friends`. Below is how a simple table might look:


## Task: Sort a table using the `ORDER BY` clause

### Lesson Overview

After using `ORDER BY`, we specify the column by which we want to order the entries.  
For example, to sort by the `name` column:

The first step in ordering a table is the SELECT
ORDER BY helps you arrange data in a readable form
Here **FROM** specifies the table we are selecting from. 
Here the query is ordering the records by the name/. 

    :::info
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="SQL Table" label="SQL Table">
```sql title="Friends"
| name    | username |
-----------|---------|
 Smith     | 19      |
 Jones     | 60      |
 Wilson    | 25      |
```
  </TabItem>

<TabItem value="SQL Code" label="SQL Code">
  
  ```sql title="Creating SQL Tables & db. "

    -- creating orders
SELECT * FROM patients
ORDER BY name;

    ```



    </TabItem>
    
    <TabItem value="how-git-works" label="Output">
| name              | age                  |
-------------------|--------------------------|
Smith       | 19    |
Jones       | 60        |
Wilson       | 25   |
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Example Practice 

> To query data from a table, use the FROM clause followed by the table's name.


For example, consider a table named `Friends`. Below is how a simple table might look:



    :::info
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="SQL Table" label="SQL Table">
```sql title="Friends"
| name    | gdp     |
|---------|---------|
| Greece  | 187.46  |
| Sweden  | 474.15  |
| Iceland | 21.6    |
| Germany | 3449.05 |

```
  </TabItem>

<TabItem value="SQL Code" label="SQL Code">
  
  ```sql title="Creating SQL Tables. "
SELECT *
FROM countries
ORDER BY name;
    ```

    </TabItem>
    
    <TabItem value="how-git-works" label="Output">
| name    | gdp     |
|---------|---------|
| Germany | 3449.05 |
| Greece  | 187.46  |
| Iceland | 21.6    |
| Sweden  | 474.15  |

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
 When requesting data with SQL staments like SELECT, we say that we are making a query.
From helps in select the name column from
While not necessary, itâ€™s a good practice to finish SQL queries with a semicolon (;).


By following these best practices, ASC is the default sort ordering method followed.

### ðŸ”„ Arranging ORDERS BY with ASC , DESC

    :::info
    Ordering text properties like name is different when comparing to the age
    We can order items in asseding starting with smalest value or deceding. 
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="SQL Table" label="SQL Table">
```sql title="friends"
| name   | age |
|--------|-----|
| Smith  | 19  |
| Jones  | 60  |
| Wilson | 25  |

```
  </TabItem>

<TabItem value="SQL Code" label="SQL Code">
  
  ```sql title="Creating SQL Tables. "
SELECT *
FROM patients
ORDER BY age ASC;

    ```

    </TabItem>
    
    <TabItem value="how-git-works" label="Output">
| name   | age |
|--------|-----|
| Smith  | 19  |
| Wilson | 25  |
| Jones  | 60  |

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::

## ðŸ§¹ Selecting with `DESC`

For Text value it order by Alphabetically 
When arranging numerical value the item with smallest value in that coloumn comes first

  <TabItem value="SQL Table" label="SQL Table">
```sql title="Subscribers"
| name   | age |
|--------|-----|
| Smith  | 19  |
| Jones  | 60  |
| Wilson | 25  |

```
  </TabItem>

<TabItem value="SQL Code" label="SQL Code">
  
  ```sql title="Creating SQL Tables. "
SELECT *
FROM patients
ORDER BY age DESC;

    ```

    </TabItem>
    
    <TabItem value="how-git-works" label="Output">

|--------|-----|
| Jones  | 60  |
| Wilson | 25  |

# âœ… What You Have Learned

This module covers essential concepts related to ordering data in SQL:

- **ORDER BY Clause**  
Learn how to sort query results based on one or more columns using the `ORDER BY` keyword.

- **Ascending Order** (ASC)  
Understand that SQL sorts in ascending order by default, which is the same as explicitly using `ASC`.

- **Descending Order** (DESC)  
Use the `DESC` keyword to sort results from highest to lowest or reverse alphabetical order.

- **Sort by Column Values**  
Practice sorting by numeric or text column values to organize data meaningfully.
